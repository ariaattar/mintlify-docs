# PigeonsAI: Enhancing Predictive Models with Context Awareness

PigeonsAI is a robust training and deployment platform specially designed for context-aware neural networks. These advanced models integrate vital contextual information such as time, sequence, location, image, and text descriptions, allowing for significantly improved accuracy across various applications.


## Core Concepts


- **Data Source Integration**: Seamlessly connect with numerous data sources to fetch real-time training data, ensuring that your models always leverage the most current information.

  

- **Model Training**: Utilize GPU-powered instances to train models effectively using the latest collected data.

  

- **Model Deployment**: Implement elastic deployment and scaling strategies post-training to facilitate efficient inference and real-time testing.

## Getting Started with PigeonsAI

### Installing SDK


To begin using PigeonsAI in your projects, install the SDK using the following commands based on your development environment:



```bash

# For Python

pip install pigeonsai

# For JavaScript

npm install pigeonsai

# For Go

go get github.com/pigeonsai/sdk-go

```

### Obtaining an API Key


To access the full capabilities of the PigeonsAI SDK, an API key is required. Follow these steps to acquire one:



1. Navigate to the [PigeonsAI API Keys page](https://pigeonsai.com/api-keys).

2. Log in and proceed to the API keys section.

3. Click on "Create new API key" and copy the key generated.

### Initializing the Client


With the API key, you can initialize the PigeonsAI client as follows:


```python

from pigeonsai import PigeonsAI

# Replace 'your_api_key' with your actual API key.

client = PigeonsAI(api_key='your_api_key')

```
